Hotbar Add-on For Final Fantasy XI
Updated: Changed up subjob function call in storage.lua to allow add-on to run for newbies. This should allow newly made characters to open this up and use it without issue. Please refer to the original master for full information on this add-on: https://github.com/SirEdeonX/FFXIAddons/tree/master/xivhotbar.
